# linesColors
 project to change lines color categories

* using this website as a guide to the colors
* potentially write some Python to determine the most active categories in the last year
* match up categories with most posts to their closest color in the Figure 4 pallete
* this gives us 10 unique colors to work with
* priority for monome to stay gray b/c it's fitting
* once the most popular categories are assigned uniques, we will see if use duplicate or if there is a way to add to pallete without ruining color blindness
* create page to show current state and future state
