# linesColors
 Project to change lines color categories

* using this website https://personal.sron.nl/~pault/ as a guide to the colors
* potentially write some Python to determine the most active categories in the last year
* match up categories with most posts to their closest color in the Figure 4 palette which has 10 colors
* priority for monome to stay gray b/c it's fitting
* this gives us 9 remaining unique colors to work with
* once the most popular categories are assigned uniques, we will see if use duplicate or if there is a way to add to the palette without breaking the color-blind safeness
* create page to show current state and future state
