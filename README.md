# linesColors
 Project to change lines color categories

* using this website https://personal.sron.nl/~pault/ as a guide to the colors
* potentially write some Python to determine the most active categories in the last year
  * can view basic data on https://llllllll.co/categories
* match up categories with most posts to their closest color in the Figure 4 palette which has 10 colors
* priority for monome to stay gray b/c it's fitting
* this gives us 9 remaining unique colors to work with 14 remaining categories
* once the most popular categories are assigned uniques, we will see if use duplicate or if there is a way to add to the palette without breaking the color-blind safeness
* create page to show current state and future state
* add JS to toggle background color for dark or light theme
* try to get future state to sit to the right of current state
* trade is by far the most popular but is not part of the main landing page so deprioritizing
